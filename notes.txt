// Music interactions:
/*
- copx - percussive synth with note from generative scale pings when copx threshold hit on either side
- synth holds at lowish level until threshold is passed again when release is triggered

- displacement:
- threshold triggers a sound which plays as long as displacement is above some threshold
- maybe as it gets closer back down to threshold, something about the synth changes?

- heading:
- this seems more like a value that will be used to indicate motions, rather than something that will be mapped raw?
- global frequency - open footed plays higher freq, opens up a filter etc..?


Generataive ideas:
- pick some melody (sequence of a few notes from scale) for one motion. Or maybe a few consonant melodies that can be iterated through (a phrase or a few phrases?)
- copx, displacement, etc... are responsible for deviating enough (but not too much) from that melody to make it interesting/not too repetitive
- deviation based on how long they've been doing that motion for - or how many notes triggered perhaps:
- motion change picks a new melody
- if

- Different but consonant/coordinated melodies for each sensor? Polyphonic melodies?
- Or is it better to have just one - perhaps more intuitive/less overwhelming
